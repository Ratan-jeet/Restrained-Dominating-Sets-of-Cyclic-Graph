# Restrained-Dominating-Sets-of-Cyclic-Graph
"algorithm1.cpp" will take input n and k where n is number of vertex in cycle and k is size of rds ( input k means find total number of restrained dominating set with cardinality k ), it will calculate all unique (n-k)/2 partition of integer k , then calculate the total number of circular arrangement possible for each partition, and multiply this total number with n which gives the total number of restrained dominating set of cardinality k.




"RDP_algo.cpp"  is a brute force approach to compute the RDP of any unlabelled graph
"Input:" 
n,k where n is number of vertex in graph, and k is number of edges in graph
enter k vertex pair for each edge (if there are 4 vertex then they are 0,1,2,3).
"Output:" Restrained domination polynmial of input graph.
