# Restrained-Dominating-Sets-of-Cyclic-Graph
"algorithm1.cpp" will take input n and k where n is number of vertex in cycle and k is coefficient of x^k in RPD of C_n ( input k means find total number of restrained dominating set with cardinality k ) and using the same above approach it will give output "total number of restrained dominating set with cardinality k"
