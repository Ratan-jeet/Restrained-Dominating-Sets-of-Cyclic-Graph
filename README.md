# Restrained-Dominating-Sets-of-Cyclic-Graph
"algorithm1.cpp" will take input n and k where n is number of vertex in cycle and k is size of rds ( input k means find total number of restrained dominating set with cardinality k ), it will calculate all unique (n-k)/2 partition of integer k , then calculate the total number of circular arrangement possible for each partition, and multiply this total number with n which gives the total number of restrained dominating set of cardinality k
